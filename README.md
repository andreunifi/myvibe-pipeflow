## Introduction

Welcome to **PipeFlow** 📦, an AI-based framework designed to automate pipelines into fully AI-driven workflows. PipeFlow aims to streamline and optimize the process of integrating various stages of data processing, model training, and deployment into a cohesive, automated pipeline.

## Features

- **Automated Data Ingestion** 📥: Seamlessly integrate data from multiple sources.
- **Data Preprocessing** 🔄: Automatic data cleaning, transformation, and normalization.
- **Model Training** 🤖: Automated model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and training.
- **Model Deployment** 🚀: Easy deployment of models to production environments.
- **Monitoring and Maintenance** 🛠️: Continuous monitoring and automatic retraining of models.
- **Extensibility** 🧩: Modular design allowing for custom components and integrations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pipeflow.git
    cd pipeflow
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

1. Initialize a new pipeline:
    ```python
    from pipeflow import Pipeline

    pipeline = Pipeline()
    ```

2. Add components to the pipeline:
    ```python
    from pipeflow.components import DataIngestion, DataPreprocessing, ModelTraining, ModelDeployment

    pipeline.add_component(DataIngestion())
    pipeline.add_component(DataPreprocessing())
    pipeline.add_component(ModelTraining())
    pipeline.add_component(ModelDeployment())
    ```

3. Run the pipeline:
    ```python
    pipeline.run()
    ```
